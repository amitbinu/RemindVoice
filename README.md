# RemindVoice
A web application that will push notification from a computer to an android phone, when a keyword is spoken to the computer. 

When this web application is launched the user can enter a keyword and click the 'start listening' button. 

The computer will listen for that word or phrase and, when it is said, the website will push a notification to the user's android phone
with a message telling the time at which this phrase was fired.
